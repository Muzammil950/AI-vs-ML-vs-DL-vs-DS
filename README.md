A visual breakdown of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science, including core concepts and applications.
# ðŸ§  AI vs ML vs DL vs DS: Core Concepts and Interrelations

This repository contains a conceptual breakdown and visualization of the four major, yet often confused, fields: **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Data Science (DS)**.

The included diagram and notes clearly define each concept, illustrate their hierarchical relationship, and provide real-world applications and the necessary mathematical foundation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts Explained

### 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* **Definition:** Smart applications that can perform their own tasks without any human intervention.
* **Examples:** Self-Driving Cars, Robots.

### 2. Machine Learning (ML)
* **Definition:** A subset of AI that provides statistical methods to learn, analyze, visualize, and develop predictive models from data. (ML $\subset$ AI)
* **Applications:** Classification, Regression, Recommendation Systems (e.g., Amazon, Netflix).

### 3. Deep Learning (DL)
* **Definition:** A subset of ML that uses **Multi-Layered Neural Networks** to mimic the human brain for complex pattern recognition. (DL $\subset$ ML)
* **Examples:** Object Detection, Image Recognition, Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT).

### 4. Data Science (DS)
* **Definition:** A broader field that encompasses ML. It focuses on the entire process of deriving knowledge and insights from data, heavily utilizing ML models.
